Q2246,what is lean manufacturing and who developed,Lean manufacturing,"Lean manufacturing, lean enterprise, or lean production, often simply, ""Lean,"" is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, ""value"" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Essentially, lean is centered on preserving value with less work. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as ""Lean"" only in the 1990s. TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of Toyota , from a small company to the world's largest automaker, has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.","LEAN MANUFACTURING, LEAN ENTERPRISE, OR LEAN PRODUCTION, OFTEN SIMPLY, ""LEAN,"" IS A PRODUCTION PRACTICE THAT CONSIDERS THE EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES FOR ANY GOAL OTHER THAN THE CREATION OF VALUE FOR THE END CUSTOMER TO BE WASTEFUL, AND THUS A TARGET FOR ELIMINATION.

Q2572,what is rationalism by john locke george berkeley,George Berkeley,"George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers , and as a result cannot exist without being perceived. Thus, as Berkeley famously put it, for physical objects ""esse est percipi"" ("" to be is to be perceived ""). Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction , an important premise in his argument for immaterialism. In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, , in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour. This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge in 1710 which, after its poor reception, he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous in 1713. In this book, Berkeley's views were represented by Philonous (Greek: 'lover of mind'), while Hylas (Greek: 'matter') embodies the Irish thinker’s opponents, in particular John Locke . Berkeley argued against Sir Isaac Newton 's doctrine of absolute space , time and motion in De Motu (on Motion), published 1721. His arguments were a precursor to the views of Mach and Einstein . In 1732, he published Alciphron , a Christian apologetic against the free-thinkers , and in 1734, he published The Analyst , an empiricist critique of the foundations of infinitesimal calculus , which was influential in the development of mathematics. His last major philosophical work, Siris (1744), begins by advocating the medicinal use of tar water , and then continues to discuss a wide range of topics including science, philosophy, and theology. Interest in Berkeley's work increased after World War II, because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.","George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others).

Q488,how many died in hiroshima and nagasaki,Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were conducted by the United States during the final stages of World War II in 1945. The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. Following a firebombing campaign that destroyed many Japanese cities, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of Japan . The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on 8 May, but the Pacific War continued. Together with the United Kingdom and the Republic of China , the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, threatening Japan with ""prompt and utter destruction"". The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum, and the United States deployed two nuclear weapons developed by the Manhattan Project . American airmen dropped Little Boy on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, followed by Fat Man over Nagasaki on 9 August. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day. The Hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that, of the people who died on the day of the explosion, 60% died from flash or flame burns, 30% from falling debris and 10% from other causes. During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness , and other injuries, compounded by illness. In a US estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death, 15–20% died from radiation sickness, 20–30% from burns, and 50–60% from other injuries, compounded by illness. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison. On 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies, signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September, officially ending World War II. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan 's adopting Three Non-Nuclear Principles , forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.

Q1321,what state was the civil war in,American Civil War,"The American Civil War (ACW), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War (see naming ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States (the ""Union"" or the ""North"") and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""Confederacy"" or the ""South""). The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. Foreign powers did not intervene. After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began. In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States' territories . Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on "" King Cotton "" that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America. Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Robert E. Lee's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg . Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864. In the Western Theater, William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way. The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital. The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars . Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I . It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.

Q1855,what states has the electric chair,Electric chair,"Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. This execution method was created by employees of Thomas Edison during the War of Currents , and has been used only in the United States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines (its first use there in 1924 under American occupation , last in 1976). Historically, once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles (differing in voltage and duration) of alternating current would be passed through the individual's body, in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs (including the brain). The first jolt of electric current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs. Death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart . Although in the United States the electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution. Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution, today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner. As of 2010, electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method. In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 (Kentucky: March 31, 1998; Tennessee: December 31, 1998) and who chose electrocution. In both states, inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are killed by lethal injection . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution. It is the sole method of execution in Vermont, where treason is the only capital crime. On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a ""cruel and unusual punishment"" under the state's constitution. This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska, the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution for murder.","Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body.

It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its primary , having 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, resulting in its mass . The Moon is the second densest satellite after Io , a satellite of Jupiter. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun , although its surface is actually very dark, with a reflectance similar to that of coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language , calendars , art and mythology . The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance, about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses . This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidence. The Moon's linear distance from the Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82±0.07cm per year, but this rate is not constant. The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago, not long after the Earth. Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars -sized body. The Moon is the only celestial body other than Earth on which humans have set foot . The Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959; the United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being Apollo 11 . These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon's origins, the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history . After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft, notably by the final Soviet Lunokhod rover . Since 2004, Japan, China, India, the United States, and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbiters. These spacecraft have contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith .

Q2862,what is bracketing in photography,Bracketing,"In photography , bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings.

Q1271,what months are in each season,Season,"A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight . Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant. During May, June and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux . However, due to seasonal lag , June, July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere. In temperate and subpolar regions, generally four calendar -based seasons (with their adjectives) are recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal) and winter (hibernal). However, ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

Q2250,what is vitamin a for,Vitamin A,"Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons, which include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important. Vitamin A has multiple functions, it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal , which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the light-absorbing molecule , that is necessary for both low-light ( scotopic vision) and color vision . Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid , which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells. In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester , primarily retinyl palmitate , which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol ) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal . The associated acid (retinoic acid), a metabolite that can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin A, has only partial vitamin A activity, and does not function in the retina for the visual cycle. Retinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiation. All forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached, called a retinyl group. Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity. The orange pigment of carrots – beta-carotene – can be represented as two connected retinyl groups, which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levels. Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group, which give them some vitamin activity. None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity. The carotenoid beta- cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods : Retinol , the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate . The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin (all of which contain beta-ionone rings), but no other carotenoids , function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme (15-15'-dioxygenase) which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it retinol. In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal (resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species).","Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons, which include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important.

Many airlines also use focus cities , which function much the same as hubs. Airlines may also use secondary hubs, a non-technical term for large focus cities. A hub in the middle of a route is more effective than at either end as connecting traffic more easily fills the plane - passengers prefer a one-stop (two-leg) route over a two-stop (three-leg) route.","Frankfurt Airport serves as a hub city for Lufthansa and receives flights from Star Alliance carriers.

Q2082,what is the name of an investigation with controlled variables,Scientific control,"Take identical growing plants and give fertilizer to half of them. If there are differences between the fertilized plant group and the unfertilized ""control"" group, these differences may be due to the fertilizer. A scientific control is an experiment or observation designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single independent variable . This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. Scientific controls are a part of the scientific method . For example, during drug testing, scientists will try to control two groups to keep them as identical as possible, then allow one group to try the drug. Another example might be testing plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the plants in a garden: the plants that receive no fertilizer are the control group, because they establish the baseline level of growth that the fertilizer-treated plants will be compared against. Without a control group, the experiment cannot determine whether the fertilizer-treated plants grow more than they would have if untreated. Ideally, all variables in an experiment will be controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none will be uncontrolled. In such an experiment, if all the controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment is working as intended and that the results of the experiment are due to the effect of the variable being tested.

Q395,what do ancients myths explain,Greek Mythology,"Bust of Zeus , Otricoli (Sala Rotonda, Museo Pio-Clementino , Vatican ). Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece and is part of religion in modern Greece and around the world , known as Hellenismos . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world, and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines , and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature . The oldest known Greek literary sources, Homer's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on events surrounding the Trojan War . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians of the fifth century BC, in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology, with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts. Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence. Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture, arts, and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language. Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes.","Bust of Zeus , Otricoli (Sala Rotonda, Museo Pio-Clementino , Vatican ).

Q1998,when did the titanic sink,RMS Titanic,"RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton , UK to New York City , US. The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage. She was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line , and she was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast with Thomas Andrews , who perished with the ship, as her naval architect. On her maiden voyage, she carried 2,224 passengers and crew. Under the command of Edward Smith , her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland , Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America. The ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use. Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, she lacked enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard. Because of outdated maritime safety regulations, she carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number travelling on the maiden voyage, and one-third her total passenger and crew capacity. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship's time. The glancing collision caused Titanics hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "" women and children first "" protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats. By 2:20 AM, she broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after the Titanic foundered, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors. The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety . One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications---which could have saved many more passengers. Many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute; many families, particularly those of crew members from Southampton, lost their primary bread-winners. They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations. Some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board; the White Star Line's chairman, J.

A projection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two-dimensional screen. The same applies to the tesseract, which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in three-dimensional space. A diagram showing the first four spatial dimensions. In physics and mathematics , the dimension of a space or object is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it (for example, the point at 5 on a number line). A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it (for example, to locate a point on the surface of a sphere you need both its latitude and its longitude ). The inside of a cube , a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces. In physical terms, dimension refers to the constituent structure of all space ( volume ) and its position in time (perceived as a scalar dimension along the t-axis), as well as the spatial constitution of objects within—structures that correlate with both particle and field conceptions, interact according to relative properties of mass —and are fundamentally mathematical in description. These, or other axes, may be referenced to uniquely identify a point or structure in its attitude and relationship to other objects and occurrences. Physical theories that incorporate time , such as general relativity , are said to work in 4-dimensional "" spacetime "", (defined as a Minkowski space ). Modern theories tend to be ""higher-dimensional"" including quantum field and string theories. The state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space . The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects.

Most burns affect only the superficial skin (known as superficial or first degree) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin (known as partial thickness or second degree). Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness (third degree) or fourth degree. The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns maybe managed with little more than simple pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers . Cooling with tap water may aid pain and decrease damage however if exposure is prolonged it may result in low body temperature . Partial thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings. Blisters should typically be left unbroken. Full thickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as skin grafting and extensive burns often require large amount of intravenous fluids . The most common complications of burns are related to infection . While large burns can be fatal, modern treatments developed in the last 50 years have significantly improved the outcomes, especially in children and young adults. Globally about 11 million people seek medical treatment and 300,000 people die from burns. In the United States, of those admitted to a burn center , approximately 4% die from their injuries.

Q283,how many canals in mandibular first molar,Mandibular first molar,"The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face ) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second molars . It is located on the mandibular (lower) arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary (upper) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion. The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication , commonly known as chewing. There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek), two lingual (side nearest the tongue ), and one distal. There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar. The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it. Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars. In the universal system of notation , the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""S"", and the left one is known as ""L"". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""84"", and the left one is known as ""74"". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular first molars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""30"", and the left one is known as ""19"". The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right first molars would have the same number, ""6"", but the right one would have the symbol, ""┐"", over it, while the left one would have, ""┌"". The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""46"", and the left one is known as ""36"". Mandibular primary first molars usually have four pulp horns. The first molar is usually the first permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones. Anatomy: The mandibular first molar has five cusps: the mesiobuccal (MB, toward midline and cheek), mesiolingual (ML, toward midline and tongue), distolingual (DL, away from midline and towards tongue), distobuccal (DB, away from midline and toward cheek), and distal (D, away from midline), listed in order of decreasing size. Listed in order of decreasing height they are: ML, DL, DF, MF, and D. An eighth cusp was found in a primary second lower molar in an Argentinean child. Viewed from the top of the tooth (occlusal view), the mandibular first molar is pentagonal (five sided) in shape and tapers toward the lingual, with the sides being the buccal surface, the mesial surface, the lingual surface, distal surface, and the distobuccal surface. The occlusal surface has four grooves. The central groove is not straight but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits (mesial, central, central, and distal). The distobuccal groove runs from the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps. The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps. The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit. The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves (buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel). From the buccal (buccal view), two roots are present. The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature. The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown.","The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face ) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second molars . It is located on the mandibular (lower) arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary (upper) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion. The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication , commonly known as chewing. There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek), two lingual (side nearest the tongue ), and one distal. There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar. The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it. Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars. In the universal system of notation , the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""S"", and the left one is known as ""L"". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""84"", and the left one is known as ""74"". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular first molars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""30"", and the left one is known as ""19"". The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right first molars would have the same number, ""6"", but the right one would have the symbol, ""┐"", over it, while the left one would have, ""┌"". The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""46"", and the left one is known as ""36"". Mandibular primary first molars usually have four pulp horns. The first molar is usually the first permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones. Anatomy: The mandibular first molar has five cusps: the mesiobuccal (MB, toward midline and cheek), mesiolingual (ML, toward midline and tongue), distolingual (DL, away from midline and towards tongue), distobuccal (DB, away from midline and toward cheek), and distal (D, away from midline), listed in order of decreasing size. Listed in order of decreasing height they are: ML, DL, DF, MF, and D. An eighth cusp was found in a primary second lower molar in an Argentinean child. Viewed from the top of the tooth (occlusal view), the mandibular first molar is pentagonal (five sided) in shape and tapers toward the lingual, with the sides being the buccal surface, the mesial surface, the lingual surface, distal surface, and the distobuccal surface. The occlusal surface has four grooves. The central groove is not straight but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits (mesial, central, central, and distal). The distobuccal groove runs from the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps. The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps. The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit. The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves (buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel). From the buccal (buccal view), two roots are present. The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature.

Q239,what does metes and bounds mean,Metes and bounds,"Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land, real property (in contrast to personal property) or real estate . The system has been used in England for many centuries, and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries. By custom, it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States , and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law . Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography , along with directions and distances, to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land. The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a point of beginning , returning back to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds . It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys. At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments. The term ""metes"" refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction. A direction may be a simple compass bearing, or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods. The term ""bounds"" refers to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public road way, or an existing building. The system is often used to define larger pieces of property (e.g. farms), and political subdivisions (e.g. town boundaries) where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive, or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description.","Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land, real property (in contrast to personal property) or real estate .

Q2699,what is the main primary bronchus,Right main bronchus,"The right main bronchus (or right primary bronchus, or right principal bronchus) is a bronchus of the respiratory system . It is wider, shorter, and more vertical in direction than the left . It is about 2.5 cm long, and enters the right lung nearly opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra . The azygos vein arches over it from behind; and the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. About 2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the upper lobe of the right lung. This is termed the eparterial branch of the bronchus, because it arises above the right pulmonary artery . The bronchus now passes below the artery, and is known as the hyparterial branch; it divides into two branches for the middle and lower lobes. If a foreign body in the airway passes through the trachea, it will most likely enter the right main bronchus instead of the left, due to the straighter alignment of the right bronchus to the trachea.","The right main bronchus (or right primary bronchus, or right principal bronchus) is a bronchus of the respiratory system .

Q598,what countries legalize marijuana,Legality of cannabis,"The legality of cannabis varies from country to country. Possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s. However, many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis, particularly in North America , South America and Europe . Furthermore, possession is legal or effectively legal in the Netherlands , North Korea and would be in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington if it were not for federal law, which governs persons in all states. The medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries, including Canada , the Czech Republic and Israel . While federal law in the United States bans all sale and possession of cannabis, enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law; two states ( Colorado and Washington ) have repealed their laws prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis and replaced them with a regulatory regime, also contrary to federal statute. Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but, apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana, most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe. Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation, use, possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use. A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis, making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment . Some jurisdictions/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users, with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes. There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in Canada . Drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs. However, simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries, particularly in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution.","The legality of cannabis varies from country to country.

Q816,what does the royal family do,British Royal Family,"The British Royal Family is the group of close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom . The term is also commonly applied to the same group of people who are the relations of the monarch in her or his role as sovereign of any of the other Commonwealth realms , thus sometimes at variance with official national terms for the family. Members of the Royal Family belong to, either by birth or marriage, the House of Windsor , since 1917, when George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha . This decision was primarily taken because Britain and her Empire were at war with Germany and given the British Royal Family's strong German ancestry; it was felt that its public image could be improved by choosing a more British house name. The new name chosen, Windsor, had absolutely no connection other than as the name of the castle which was and continues to be a royal residence. Although in the United Kingdom there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family, and different lists will include different people, those carrying the style Her or His Majesty (HM) , or Her or His Royal Highness (HRH) are always considered members, which usually results in the application of the term to the monarch, the consort of the monarch, the widowed consorts of previous monarchs, the children of the monarch and previous monarchs, the male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, and the spouses and the widows of a monarch's and previous monarch's sons and male-line grandsons. On 30 November 1917, King George V issued Letters Patent defining who are members of the Royal Family; the text of the notice from the London Gazette is as follows: In 1996, Her Majesty The Queen modified these Letters Patent, as was evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette: In 2013 Letters Patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the Royal Family to additional persons to be born, evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette: Members and relatives of the British Royal Family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the British Empire , sometimes for extended periods as viceroys , or for specific ceremonies or events. Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Aside from the monarch, their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve, if eligible and when appointed by letters patent, as a Counsellor of State , two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown (within stipulated limits) in the indisposal or absence from the British realm of the monarch. In the other realms of the Commonwealth royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State. However in each such realm the monarch's family members may act on behalf of, are funded by, and represent the sovereign of that particular state, and not the United Kingdom. The Queen, her consort, her children and grandchildren, as well as all former sovereigns' children and grandchildren hold places in the first sections of the official orders of precedence in England and Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland . Wives of the said enjoy their husbands' precedence, and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well. However, the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the Royal Family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra, who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall, who is otherwise the realm's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself.

Q978,how does lex luthor die in superman,Lex Luthor,"Luthor redirects here. For other uses, see Luther (disambiguation) . Alexander Joseph ""Lex"" Luthor is a fictional character , a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics . Luthor is the archenemy of Superman , and as a high-status supervillain, has also come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe . Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster , the character first appeared in Action Comics #23 (April 1940 ). Luthor is described as ""a power-mad, evil scientist"" of high intelligence and incredible technological prowess. Luthor's goals typically center on killing Superman, the foremost obstacle to achieving the villain's megalomaniacal goals. Despite periodically wearing a powered exoskeleton , Luthor has traditionally lacked superpowers or a dual identity . The character was originally depicted as a mad scientist who, in the vein of pulp novels , wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry. In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown with a full head of red hair . Despite this, the character later became hairless as the result of an artist's mistake. A 1960 story by Jerry Siegel expanded upon Luthor's origin and motivations, revealing him to be a childhood friend of Superman 's who lost his hair when a fire destroyed his laboratory; Luthor vowed revenge. Following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths , the character was re-imagined as a Machiavellian industrialist and white-collar criminal, even briefly serving as President of the United States . In recent years, various writers have revived Luthor's mad scientist persona from the 1940s. The character was ranked as the 8th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list. IGN 's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Luthor as #4. Luthor is also described as a ""megavillain"" by comic book critic Peter Sanderson , one of a few genre-crossing villains whose adventures take place ""in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended""; characters such as Professor Moriarty , Count Dracula , Hannibal Lecter , Doctor Doom , and Darth Vader , also fit this description.","Luthor redirects here.

The character was originally depicted as a mad scientist who, in the vein of pulp novels , wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry. In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown with a full head of red hair . Despite this, the character later became hairless as the result of an artist's mistake. A 1960 story by Jerry Siegel expanded upon Luthor's origin and motivations, revealing him to be a childhood friend of Superman 's who lost his hair when a fire destroyed his laboratory; Luthor vowed revenge. Following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths , the character was re-imagined as a Machiavellian industrialist and white-collar criminal, even briefly serving as President of the United States . In recent years, various writers have revived Luthor's mad scientist persona from the 1940s. The character was ranked as the 8th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list. IGN 's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Luthor as #4. Luthor is also described as a ""megavillain"" by comic book critic Peter Sanderson , one of a few genre-crossing villains whose adventures take place ""in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended""; characters such as Professor Moriarty , Count Dracula , Hannibal Lecter , Doctor Doom , and Darth Vader , also fit this description.",false,unrelated,unrelated,4.26827079099894
Q1626,what president was theodore roosevelt,Theodore Roosevelt,"Theodore ""T.R."" Roosevelt, Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858—January 6, 1919) was the 26th President of the United States (1901–1909). He is noted for his exuberant personality, range of interests and achievements, and his leadership of the Progressive Movement , as well as his "" cowboy "" persona and robust masculinity . He was a leader of the Republican Party and founder of the first incarnation of the short-lived Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party of 1912 . Before becoming President, he held offices at the city, state, and federal levels. Roosevelt's achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as a politician. Roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as President of the United States in 1901, making him the youngest president ever; he beat out the youngest elected president, John F. Kennedy , by only one year. Roosevelt was also the first of only three sitting presidents to have won the Nobel Peace Prize . The Teddy bear is named after him, despite his contempt for being called ""Teddy"". Born into a wealthy family in New York City, Roosevelt was a sickly child who suffered from asthma and stayed at home studying natural history . To overcome his physical weakness, he embraced a strenuous life. Home-schooled, he became an eager student of nature. He attended Harvard University , where he studied biology, boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs. In 1881, one year out of Harvard, he was elected to the New York State Assembly , where he became a leader of the reform faction of his Republican Party (the ""GOP""). His The Naval War of 1812 (1882) established his professional reputation as a serious historian; he wrote numerous books on hunting, the outdoors, and current political issues, as well as frontier history. In 1884, his first wife and his mother died on the same day. He temporarily left politics and went to the frontier, becoming a rancher in the ""Badlands"" in the Dakotas. Returning to New York City, he ran for mayor in 1886, finishing third with 60,000 votes. He later gained fame by taking vigorous charge of the city police. At the national level, he was a leader in civil service reform. The Spanish–American War broke out in 1898 while Roosevelt was, effectively, running the Department of the Navy . He promptly resigned and formed the Rough Riders – a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in Cuba . The war hero was elected governor in 1898 and in 1900 was nominated for vice president. He successfully energized the GOP base as a highly visible campaigner to reelect President William McKinley on a platform of high tariffs, the gold standard, imperialism, prosperity at home and victory abroad. In 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became President. He attempted to move the Republican Party (GOP) toward Progressivism , including trust busting and increased regulation of businesses. Roosevelt became the first person elected to a term in his own right in 1904 after having ascended to the Presidency (from the Vice-Presidency) upon the death of his predecessor, winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since the uncontested election of 1820 . Roosevelt coined the phrase "" Square Deal "" to describe his domestic agenda, emphasizing that the average citizen would get a fair share under his policies. As an outdoorsman and naturalist, he promoted the conservation movement . On the world stage, Roosevelt's policies were characterized by his slogan, "" Speak softly and carry a big stick "".","Theodore ""T.R."" ROOSEVELT, JR.

The title of the act is a ten letter acronym (USA PATRIOT) that stands for Uniting (and) Strengthening America (by) Providing Appropriate Tools Required (to) Intercept (and) Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001. The act, as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th , significantly reduced restrictions in law enforcement agencies' gathering of intelligence within the United States; expanded the Secretary of the Treasury’s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadened the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts.

History can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing ""perspective"" on the problems of the present.

Q2409,what is leasehold; real estate,Leasehold estate,"A leasehold estate is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant holds rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord . Although a tenant does hold rights to real property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property. Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time. As lease is a legal estate, leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market. A leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time, and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let (rented) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly. Until the end of the lease period (often measured in decades or centuries; a 99 year lease is quite common) the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner. Terms of the agreement are contained in a lease , which has elements of contract and property law intertwined. The term estate for years may occasionally be used. This refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time (the word ""years"" is misleading). An estate for years is not automatically renewed. Colloquially, ""lease"" and "" leasing "" are often a formalization of a longer, specific period as compared with a ""rental"" that created a tenancy at will , terminable or renewable at the end of a short period.","A LEASEHOLD ESTATE IS AN OWNERSHIP OF A TEMPORARY RIGHT TO HOLD LAND OR PROPERTY IN WHICH A LESSEE OR A TENANT HOLDS RIGHTS OF REAL PROPERTY BY SOME FORM OF TITLE FROM A LESSOR OR LANDLORD .

A third method, using a completely different astronomical approach based on a lunar Crucifixion darkness and eclipse model (consistent with Apostle Peter 's reference to a ""moon of blood"" in Acts 2:20 ), points to Friday, 3 April AD 33.",true,relevant,relevant,5.3620830419968115

Q1438,"what is ""thin film"" technology",Thin film,"A thin film is a layer of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer ( monolayer ) to several micrometers in thickness. Electronic semiconductor devices and optical coatings are the main applications benefiting from thin-film construction. A familiar application of thin films is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors. A very-thin-film coating (less than a nanometer thick) is used to produce two-way mirrors . The performance of optical coatings (e.g. antireflective , or AR, coatings) are typically enhanced when the thin-film coating consists of multiple layers having varying thicknesses and refractive indices . Similarly, a periodic structure of alternating thin films of different materials may collectively form a so-called superlattice which exploits the phenomenon of quantum confinement by restricting electronic phenomena to two-dimensions. Work is being done with ferromagnetic and ferroelectric thin films for use as computer memory . It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via thin-film drug delivery . Thin-films are used to produce thin-film batteries . Thin films are also used in dye-sensitized solar cells . Ceramic thin films are in wide use. The relatively high hardness and inertness of ceramic materials make this type of thin coating of interest for protection of substrate materials against corrosion, oxidation and wear. In particular, the use of such coatings on cutting tools can extend the life of these items by several orders of magnitude. Research is being done on a new class of thin-film inorganic oxide materials, called amorphous heavy-metal cation multicomponent oxides, which could be used to make transparent transistors that are inexpensive, stable, and environmentally benign.","A THIN FILM IS A LAYER OF MATERIAL RANGING FROM FRACTIONS OF A NANOMETER ( MONOLAYER ) TO SEVERAL MICROMETERS IN THICKNESS.

Q1674,Who played Spanky on Little Rascals,Our Gang,"Title card for the 1937 Our Gang comedy Rushin' Ballet . Our Gang (also known as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach's Rascals) are a series of American comedy short films about a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures. Created by comedy producer Hal Roach , the series is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way, as Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected, raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles. In addition, Our Gang notably put boys, girls, whites and blacks together in a group as equals, something that ""broke new ground,"" according to film historian Leonard Maltin . Such a thing had never been done before in cinema but has since been repeated after the success of Our Gang. The first production at the Roach studio in 1922 was a series of silent short subjects. When Roach changed distributors from Pathé to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1927, and converted the series to sound in 1929, the series took off even further. Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938, when the series was sold to MGM, who then continued producing the comedies until 1944. The Our Gang series includes a total of 220 shorts and one feature film, General Spanky , featuring over forty-one child actors . As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights, the 80 Roach-produced ""talkies"" were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955. Both Roach's The Little Rascals package (now owned by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM's Our Gang package (now owned by Warner Bros.

Q474,how much water is the human body made of,Body water,"In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body . A significant fraction of the human body is water. Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that ""the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight. In a newborn infant, this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight, but it progressively decreases from birth to old age, most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life. Also, obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body, sometimes to as low as 45 percent"". These figures are statistical averages, so are illustrative, and like all biostatistics, will vary with things like type of population, age and number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure. For example, Jackson's (1985) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60% for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water, which approximates Guyton's 57%. In diseased states where body water is affected, the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem. Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide . Per Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology, body water is broken down into the following compartments: Intracellular fluid (2/3 of body water). Per Guyton, in a body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5% (5/8), close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb. Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular. Extracellular fluid (1/3 of body water). Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5% Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here. Plasma (1/5 of extracellular fluid). Per Guyton's illustration, of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid, plasma volume averages 3 litres. This amounts to 20%, the same as per Netter's Atlas.

Q2851,where is thomas more buried,Thomas More,"Sir Thomas More (; 7 February 14786 July 1535), known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas More since 1935, was an English lawyer, social philosopher , author, statesman , and noted Renaissance humanist . He was an important councillor to Henry VIII of England and was Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532. He was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century. In 2000, Pope John Paul II declared him patron of Catholic statesmen and politicians. More was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation , in particular of Martin Luther and William Tyndale . However, since 1980, he is also commemorated by the Church of England as a reformation martyr. More coined the word "" utopia "" – a name he gave to the ideal and imaginary island nation, the political system of which he described in Utopia , published in 1516. He opposed the King's separation from the Roman Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England , a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534 . He was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath required by the First Succession Act , because the act disparaged Papal Authority and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon . In 1535, he was tried for treason , convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded. More also helped to originate the phrase ""grasp at straws"" to mean ""desperately trying even useless things"", in his Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation. Intellectuals and statesmen across Europe were stunned by More's execution. Erasmus saluted him as one ""whose soul was more pure than any snow, whose genius was such that England never had and never again will have its like"". There was a more controversial side to More's life, because he advocated the persecution and execution of Protestants who refused to recant their faith. However, the judgement of history has been largely willing to forgive this in light of the times he lived in and his martyrdom in the Roman Catholic cause. Two centuries later Jonathan Swift said More was ""the person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced"", a sentiment with which Samuel Johnson agreed. Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper said in 1977 that More was ""the first great Englishman whom we feel that we know, the most saintly of humanists, the most human of saints, the universal man of our cool northern renaissance.""","Sir Thomas More (; 7 February 14786 July 1535), known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas More since 1935, was an English lawyer, social philosopher , author, statesman , and noted Renaissance humanist .

Q96,how can hoa collect unpaid fees on property,Homeowner association,"For a discussion of nonprofit, voluntary neighborhood advocacy groups, see neighborhood association . In the United States, a homeowner association is a corporation formed by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing, managing, and selling of homes and lots in a residential subdivision. It grants the developer privileged voting rights in governing the association, while allowing the developer to exit financial and legal responsibility of the organization, typically by transferring ownership of the association to the homeowners after selling off a predetermined number of lots. Membership in the homeowners association by a residential buyer is typically a condition of purchase; a buyer isn't given an option to reject it. Most homeowner associations are incorporated, and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and homeowner associations. State oversight of homeowner associations is minimal, and mainly takes the form of laws which are inconsistent from state to state. Some states, such as Florida and California, have a large body of homeowner association law, and some states, such as Massachusetts, have virtually no homeowner association law. The fastest growing form of housing in the United States today is common-interest developments (CIDs), a category that includes planned-unit developments of single-family homes , condominiums , and cooperative apartments . Since 1964, homeowner associations have become increasingly common in the USA.

Some states, such as Florida and California, have a large body of homeowner association law, and some states, such as Massachusetts, have virtually no homeowner association law. The fastest growing form of housing in the United States today is common-interest developments (CIDs), a category that includes planned-unit developments of single-family homes , condominiums , and cooperative apartments . Since 1964, homeowner associations have become increasingly common in the USA. The Community Associations Institute trade association estimated that HOAs governed 24.8 million American homes and 62 million residents in 2010.",false,unrelated,unrelated,10.288428041996667

Q804,what do jehovah witnesses believe,Jehovah's Witnesses,"Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity .Sources for descriptors:• Millenarian: • Restorationist: • Christian: • Denomination: The organization reports worldwide membership of over 7.78 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance of over 12 million, and annual Memorial attendance of over 19 million. They are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn, New York , that establishes all doctrines. Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs are based on their interpretations of the Bible and they prefer to use their own translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom on earth is the only solution for all problems faced by mankind. The group emerged from the Bible Student movement —founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell with the formation of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society —with significant organizational and doctrinal changes under the leadership of Joseph Franklin Rutherford . The name Jehovah's witnesses, based on Isaiah 43:10–12, was adopted in 1931 to distinguish themselves from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell's traditions. Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching, distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship. They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines. They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays , or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity. Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as ""the truth"" and consider themselves to be ""in the truth"". They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses. Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned. Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant. The religion's position regarding conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute national flags has brought it into conflict with some governments. Consequently, Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted and their activities are banned or restricted in some countries. Persistent legal challenges by Jehovah's Witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries.","Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity .Sources for descriptors:• Millenarian: • Restorationist: • Christian: • Denomination: The organization reports worldwide membership of over 7.78 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance of over 12 million, and annual Memorial attendance of over 19 million.

In his De nova stella (On the new star) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm . His precise measurements indicated that ""new stars,"" (stellae novae , now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572 , lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena, and were therefore not ""atmospheric"" tailless comets as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and moon. Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly ""immutable"" celestial spheres . As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system . Furthermore, he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers, working without telescopes for his observations. Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg , an early research institute , where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later Stjerneborg , underground, when he discovered that his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady.

Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists so they could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks . Two of those planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within two hours, both towers collapsed with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the WTC complex, as well as major damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense ), leading to a partial collapse in its western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93 , was targeted at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania , after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. In total, almost 3,000 people died in the attacks , including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes. Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda.

Q958,what happened on april 11 1861 at fort sumter,Battle of Fort Sumter,"The Battle of Fort Sumter (April 12–14, 1861) was the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter , near Charleston, South Carolina , that started the American Civil War . Following declarations of secession by seven Southern states , South Carolina demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, 1860, U.S. Major Robert Anderson surreptitiously moved his small command from the indefensible Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson, using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West , failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area, except for Fort Sumter. During the early months of 1861, the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege. In March, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard , the first general officer of the newly formed Confederate States of America , was placed in command of Confederate forces in Charleston. Beauregard energetically directed the strengthening of batteries around Charleston harbor aimed at Fort Sumter. Conditions in the fort grew dire as the Union soldiers rushed to complete the installation of additional guns. Anderson was short of men, food, and supplies. The resupply of Fort Sumter became the first crisis of the administration of President Abraham Lincoln . He notified the Governor of South Carolina, Francis W. Pickens , that he was sending supply ships, which resulted in an ultimatum from the Confederate government: evacuate Fort Sumter immediately. Major Anderson refused to surrender. Beginning at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, the Confederates bombarded the fort from artillery batteries surrounding the harbor. Although the Union garrison returned fire, they were significantly outgunned and, after 34 hours, Major Anderson agreed to evacuate. There was no loss of life on either side as a direct result of this engagement, although a gun explosion during the surrender ceremonies on April 14 caused two Union deaths. Following the battle, there was widespread support from both North and South for further military action. Lincoln's immediate call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion resulted in an additional four southern slave states also declaring their secession and joining the Confederacy.

Q2627,when was the Declaration of Independence Signing,United States Declaration of Independence,"The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies , then at war with Great Britain , regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire . Instead they now formed a new nation—the United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was unanimously approved on July 2. A committee had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when congress voted on independence. Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, which congress would edit to produce the final version. The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . The national birthday, the Independence Day is celebrated on July 4, although Adams wanted July 2. After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the Declaration of Independence, is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4, the date of its signing was August 2. The original July 4 United States Declaration of Independence manuscript was lost while all other copies have been derived from this original document. The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III , and by asserting certain natural and legal rights , including a right of revolution . Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the American Revolution . Since then, it has come to be considered a major statement on human rights , particularly its second sentence: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . This has been called ""one of the best-known sentences in the English language"", containing ""the most potent and consequential words in American history."" The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln , who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted. It has inspired work for the rights of marginalized people throughout the world.","The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies , then at war with Great Britain , regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire .

The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia . The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia . Serbian military officers stood behind the attack. At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević , his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and Masterspy Rade Malobabić. Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary. The assassins, the key members of the clandestine tunnel, and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records. Assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later.","A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination and steps of Gavrilo Princip (image taken in 1987, before steps were removed in 1992 and plaque changed from Cyrillic to Latin script) A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination (image taken in 2009) ON 28 JUNE 1914, ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND OF AUSTRIA , HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN THRONE, AND HIS WIFE, SOPHIE, DUCHESS OF HOHENBERG , WERE SHOT DEAD IN SARAJEVO , BY GAVRILO PRINCIP , ONE OF A GROUP OF SIX BOSNIAN SERB ASSASSINS COORDINATED BY DANILO ILIĆ .

She is Supreme Governor of the Church of England and, in some of her realms, carries the title of Defender of the Faith as part of her full title. On her accession on 6 February 1952, Elizabeth became Head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Pakistan and Ceylon . From 1956 to 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. At present, in addition to the first four aforementioned countries, Elizabeth is Queen of Jamaica , Barbados , the Bahamas , Grenada , Papua New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , Tuvalu , Saint Lucia , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , Belize , Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Kitts and Nevis . Her reign of years is currently the second longest for a British monarch ; only Queen Victoria has reigned longer at over 63 years. Elizabeth was born in London and educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne as George VI in 1936 on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII , from which time she was the heir presumptive . She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War , in which she served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service . In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh , with whom she has four children: Charles , Anne , Andrew , and Edward . Her coronation service took place in 1953 and was the first to be televised. The Queen's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland and reciprocal visits to and from the Pope . The Queen has seen major constitutional changes in her realms, such as devolution in the United Kingdom and the patriation of the Canadian constitution. Times of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children, the births of her grandchildren, the investiture of the Prince of Wales , and the celebration of milestones such as her Silver , Golden , and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. Major events in the Queen's reign have included the Troubles in Northern Ireland , the Falklands War , wars with Iraq and the War in Afghanistan . There have been times of personal sorrow for her which include the death of her father at 56, the assassination of Prince Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten , the breakdown of her children's marriages in 1992 (a year deemed her annus horribilis ), the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law, Diana, Princess of Wales , and the deaths of her mother and sister in 2002. The Queen has occasionally faced severe press criticism of the royal family and republican sentiments, but support for the monarchy and her personal popularity remain high.","Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) is the constitutional monarch of 16 sovereign states , known as the Commonwealth realms , and their territories and dependencies, and head of the 54-member Commonwealth of Nations .

Q2987,what is negligence in tort?,Negligence,"Negligence (Lat. negligentia, from neglegere, to neglect, literally ""not to pick up something"") is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances. The area of tort law known as negligence involves harm caused by carelessness, not intentional harm. According to Jay M. Feinman of the Rutgers University School of Law; ""The core idea of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause harm to other people."" ""those who go personally or bring property where they know that they or it may come into collision with the persons or property of others have by law a duty cast upon them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such a collision."" Fletcher v Rylands ([1866] LR 1 Ex 265) Through civil litigation, if an injured person proves that another person acted negligently to cause their injury, they can recover damages to compensate for their harm. Proving a case for negligence can potentially entitle the injured plaintiff to compensation for harm to their body, property, mental well-being, financial status, or intimate relationships. However, because negligence cases are very fact-specific, this general definition does not fully explain the concept of when the law will require one person to compensate another for losses caused by accidental injury. Further, the law of negligence at common law is only one aspect of the law of liability. Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action, the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases.","Negligence (Lat. negligentia, from neglegere, to neglect, literally ""not to pick up something"") is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances.

Q2018,what is the rationale for outsourcing in firms,outsourcing,"Outsourcing is the contracting out of an internal business process to a third-party organization. The practice of contracting a business process out to a third party rather than staffing it internally is common in the modern economy. The term ""outsourcing"" became popular in the United States near the turn of the 21st century. Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another, but not always. The definition of outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting, and sometimes includes offshoring , which means relocating a business function to another country. Financial savings from lower international labor rates is a big motivation for outsourcing/offshoring. The opposite of outsourcing is called insourcing , which entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration . However, a business can provide a contract service to another business without necessarily insourcing that business process.","Outsourcing is the contracting out of an internal business process to a third-party organization.

Q97,how big can texel guinea pigs become,List of guinea pig breeds,"A prize-winning lilac-and-white Silkie There are many breeds of Guinea pig which have been developed since its domestication ca. 5000 BC. Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose, ranging from show breeds with long, flowing hair to those in use as model organisms by science. From ca. 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532, selective breeding by indigenous South American peoples resulted in many varieties of domestic Guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds. Early Andean breeds were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food, and efforts at improving the Guinea pig as a food source continue to the modern era. With the export of Guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets. To this end, various competitive breeding organizations were founded by fanciers. The American Cavy Breeders Association , an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders Association , is the governing body in the United States and Canada. The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council) and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Club). Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing. New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century. Though there are many breeds of Guinea pig, only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets. Most Guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable by breeders or were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they meet the breed standard of perfection. The short hair, Abyssinian, Peruvian and Sheltie (aka Silkie) breeds are those most frequently seen as pets, and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of Guinea pigs. In addition to their standard form, nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant. Satins, due to their hollow hair shafts, possess coats of a special gloss and shine. However, there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the Satin coat also can cause severe bone problems, including Osteodystrophy and Paget's disease . Showing Satin variations is prohibited by some cavy breeders' associations because of animal welfare reasons. All cavy breeds have some shared general standards: the head profile should be rounded, with large eyes and large, smooth ears. The body should be strong and of compact build. Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip. These standards are best met by long established, commonly bred breeds, as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities. The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth coated breeds, which have had well established, separate breeding lines for different colours.","A prize-winning lilac-and-white Silkie There are many breeds of Guinea pig which have been developed since its domestication ca. 5000 BC.

Thirteen actors have appeared as the same character in all eight films of the franchise. Some well-known British actors who have not appeared in the series, are asked in jest why they have not been cast. When David Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy , who had previously collaborated with Yates on three of his television projects, said that he joked with Yates that maybe now he wouldn't be the only actor in England who hadn't been in Harry Potter. ""But nobody called"", Nighy added. But in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in Deathly Hallows.

Q943,how many innings makes an official game,Official game,"An official game in baseball , also sometimes called a regulation game, is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary. This is approximately the halfway point of the game. In the case of inclement weather , any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed, with the result being final, and all records and statistics counted. A game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game (to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage), or is simply canceled and replayed from the start. (This depends on the rules of each individual league .) In either case, no statistics are counted until the game becomes official. Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game. If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point. If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 41⁄2 innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game. The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning, since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth. In nearly all cases, the ""official game"" status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets. If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official, fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or (in most cases) any other available game of their choice. If a game is halted after it becomes official, the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given. The ""official game"" statistic received some attention during the 1995 season, when Cal Ripken, Jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played , previously held by Lou Gehrig . Large numbers were hung on the side of the B&O Warehouse at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to show the number of games in Ripken's streak. Each day, a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official (since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point). A similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums (including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003, Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis in 2005, and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008); as each game became official, the team would unveil a new (lower) number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium.","An official game in baseball , also sometimes called a regulation game, is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary.

Q579,how poverty affects intelligence,Poverty,"An example of urban poverty in this slum in Jakarta , Indonesia Poverty is the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money. Absolute poverty or destitution refers to the deprivation of basic human needs , which commonly includes food, water , sanitation, clothing, shelter, health care and education. Relative poverty is defined contextually as economic inequality in the location or society in which people live. For much of history, poverty was considered largely unavoidable as traditional modes of production were insufficient to give an entire population a comfortable standard of living. After the industrial revolution , mass production in factories made wealth increasingly more inexpensive and accessible. Of more importance is the modernization of agriculture , such as fertilizers , in order to provide enough yield to feed the population. The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on government services such as corruption, tax avoidance , debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms, and providing financial services. Poverty reduction is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank . The World Bank estimated 1.29 billion people were living in absolute poverty in 2008. Of these, about 400 million people in absolute poverty lived in India and 173 million people in China. In USA 1 in 5 children lives in poverty. In terms of percentage of regional populations, sub-Saharan Africa at 47% had the highest incidence rate of absolute poverty in 2008. Between 1990 and 2010, about 663 million people moved above the absolute poverty level.

Q1774,who overthrows france,Napoleon,"Imperial Standard of Napoleon I Napoleon Bonaparte ( , ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815. His legal reform, the Napoleonic Code , has been a major influence on many civil law jurisdictions worldwide, but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against France by a series of coalitions, the so-called Napoleonic Wars . He established hegemony over most of continental Europe and sought to spread the ideals of the French Revolution, while consolidating an imperial monarchy which restored aspects of the deposed Ancien Régime . Due to his success in these wars, often against numerically superior enemies, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, and his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide. Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica in a family of noble Italian ancestry which had settled Corsica in the 16th century. He trained as an artillery officer in mainland France. He rose to prominence under the French First Republic and led successful campaigns against the First and Second Coalitions arrayed against France. He led a successful invasion of the Italian peninsula. In 1799, he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as First Consul ; five years later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor, following a plebiscite in his favour. In the first decade of the 19th century, the French Empire under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars —that involved every major European power. After a streak of victories, France secured a dominant position in continental Europe, and Napoleon maintained the French sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French client states .

As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815. His legal reform, the Napoleonic Code , has been a major influence on many civil law jurisdictions worldwide, but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against France by a series of coalitions, the so-called Napoleonic Wars . He established hegemony over most of continental Europe and sought to spread the ideals of the French Revolution, while consolidating an imperial monarchy which restored aspects of the deposed Ancien Régime . Due to his success in these wars, often against numerically superior enemies, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, and his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide. Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica in a family of noble Italian ancestry which had settled Corsica in the 16th century. He trained as an artillery officer in mainland France. He rose to prominence under the French First Republic and led successful campaigns against the First and Second Coalitions arrayed against France. He led a successful invasion of the Italian peninsula. In 1799, he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as First Consul ; five years later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor, following a plebiscite in his favour. In the first decade of the 19th century, the French Empire under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars —that involved every major European power. After a streak of victories, France secured a dominant position in continental Europe, and Napoleon maintained the French sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French client states .

Q201,how many series in hockey before the stanley cup,Stanley Cup,"The Stanley Cup () is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner after the conclusion of the Stanley Cup Finals . Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston , then- Governor General of Canada , who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC . In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, the Stanley ""Presentation Cup"" was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947. There are actually three Stanley Cups : the original bowl of the ""Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup"", the authenticated ""Presentation Cup"", and the ""Replica Cup"" at the Hall of Fame. The NHL has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks. Nevertheless, the NHL does not actually own the trophy, but instead uses it by agreement with the two Trustees of the Cup. The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup, although the league's right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been disputed by some legal experts. Unlike the trophies awarded by the other three major professional sports leagues of North America, a new Stanley Cup is not made each year; winners keep it until a new champion is crowned. It is unusual among trophies, in that it has the names of all of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff engraved on its chalice . Initially, a new band added each year caused the trophy to grow in size, earning the nickname ""Stovepipe Cup"". In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band. To avoid the Stanley Cup from growing, when the bottom band is full, the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band added to the bottom. It has been referred to as The Cup, Lord Stanley's Cup, The Holy Grail, or facetiously (chiefly by sportswriters) as Lord Stanley's Mug. The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions , the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team. The original bowl was made of silver and is 18.5 centimetres (7.28 inches) in height and 29 centimetres (11.42 inches) in diameter. The current Stanley Cup, topped with a copy of the original bowl, is made of a silver and nickel alloy ; it has a height of 89.54 centimetres (35.25 inches) and weighs 15.5 kilograms (34.5 lb / 2 st 61⁄2 lb). Since the 1914–15 season, the Cup has been won a combined 94 times by 18 active NHL teams and five defunct teams. Prior to that, the challenge cup was held by nine different teams. The Montreal Canadiens have won the Cup a record 24 times and are currently the last Canadian-based team in the NHL to win the cup after winning it in 1993 .

Q514,how do you know if a volcano is extinct,Volcano,"Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska photographed from the International Space Station , May 2006. Ash plumes reached a height of 19 km during the climactic eruption at Mount Pinatubo , Philippines in 1991. A volcano is an opening, or rupture , in a planet's surface or crust , which allows hot magma , volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface. Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging . A mid-oceanic ridge , for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust in the interiors of plates, e.g., in the East African Rift , the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in North America. This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of ""Plate hypothesis"" volcanism. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes . These so-called "" hotspots "", for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth. Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere ; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere .

Q2949,when was Saddle Creek founded,Saddle Creek Records,"Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska . Started as a college class project on entrepreneurship, the label was founded by Mike Mogis and Justin Oberst in 1993 (as Lumberjack Records). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel . The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes , Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band , Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk ), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia , currently of Cursive and The Good Life ), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the ""Creekers"". Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to ""Spend an evening with Saddle Creek"" (later to be the title of the label's DVD.) Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship. Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance , which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella. Saddle Creek Records continues to be the flagship label of a style of music called ""The Omaha Sound "", characterized by a slight country twang. This is increasingly inaccurate, though, with the rise of more electronic sounds such as those favored by The Faint and Broken Spindles . The eclectic sounds of Saddle Creek's disparate member bands is somewhat explained by their history; a number of the original members of the label attended grade school together. A ""sister label"", of sorts, to Saddle Creek is Team Love , started by Conor Oberst in 2004. The label opened arms to their first bands not based in Omaha in 2001 with releases by Now It's Overhead and Sorry About Dresden . Other non-Nebraskan artists followed, including Los Angeles's Rilo Kiley , Eric Bachmann (formerly leader of Archers of Loaf and Crooked Fingers from North Carolina ), Georgie James ( Washington D.C. ), Two Gallants ( San Francisco ), and most recently Tokyo Police Club ( Toronto ). In 2005, Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek , a documentary detailing the first ten years of the record label's history, was released.

On June 8, 2007, the label opened their own music venue named Slowdown (after the group Slowdown Virginia ), located in downtown Omaha, Nebraska .","Saddle Creek Records is an American record label based in Omaha, Nebraska . STARTED AS A COLLEGE CLASS PROJECT ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE LABEL WAS FOUNDED BY MIKE MOGIS AND JUSTIN OBERST IN 1993 (AS LUMBERJACK RECORDS). Mogis soon turned over his role in the company to Robb Nansel . The label is named after Saddle Creek Road, a street that cuts through the east side of midtown Omaha, and the beginnings of a scene whose members included Conor Oberst (then a solo artist, currently of Bright Eyes , Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band , Desaparecidos and Monsters of Folk ), Tim Kasher (then of Slowdown Virginia , currently of Cursive and The Good Life ), and others. Collectively, they were known unofficially as the ""Creekers"". Saddle Creek first appeared in print on a show flyer, offering to ""Spend an evening with Saddle Creek"" (later to be the title of the label's DVD.) Saddle Creek became an incorporated entity as a result of a class project on entrepreneurship. Distribution is handled by the Alternative Distribution Alliance , which is under the Warner Music Group umbrella. Saddle Creek Records continues to be the flagship label of a style of music called ""The Omaha Sound "", characterized by a slight country twang. This is increasingly inaccurate, though, with the rise of more electronic sounds such as those favored by The Faint and Broken Spindles . The eclectic sounds of Saddle Creek's disparate member bands is somewhat explained by their history; a number of the original members of the label attended grade school together. A ""sister label"", of sorts, to Saddle Creek is Team Love , started by Conor Oberst in 2004. The label opened arms to their first bands not based in Omaha in 2001 with releases by Now It's Overhead and Sorry About Dresden . Other non-Nebraskan artists followed, including Los Angeles's Rilo Kiley , Eric Bachmann (formerly leader of Archers of Loaf and Crooked Fingers from North Carolina ), Georgie James ( Washington D.C. ), Two Gallants ( San Francisco ), and most recently Tokyo Police Club ( Toronto ). In 2005, Spend an Evening with Saddle Creek , a documentary detailing the first ten years of the record label's history, was released. The DVD features extensive interviews with the Saddle Creek bands, archival footage, and rare live performances. On June 8, 2007, the label opened their own music venue named Slowdown (after the group Slowdown Virginia ), located in downtown Omaha, Nebraska .",true,relevant,relevant,2.9268530839981395

He was drafted in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft as the fifth overall selection by the Jets and the second quarterback taken overall. He played college football at the University of Southern California (USC). Sanchez grew up in a well-disciplined and athletic family. In the eighth grade, he began to play football and learn the intricacies of the quarterback position, training with his father, Nick. A well-regarded prospect, Sanchez committed to Southern California following his successful high school career in which he led his team to a championship title during his final season. At USC, Sanchez was relegated as the backup quarterback during his first three years though he rose to prominence due to his brief appearances on the field in 2007 due to injuries suffered by starting quarterback John David Booty . Sanchez also became popular within the community due to his Mexican-American heritage. Named the starter in 2008, Sanchez led USC to a 12–1 record and won the Rose Bowl against Penn State for which Sanchez was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense . Although many considered him too inexperienced, Sanchez announced his intention to enter the 2009 NFL Draft . He was selected by the Jets after they traded up with the Cleveland Browns , and was named the starting quarterback prior to the start of the season .

Q420,how much total wealth in USA,Wealth in the United States,"Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth , which is the sum of all assets , including home equity , minus all liabilities . The total net worth of US households and nonprofit organizations 1945–2009, unadjusted for inflation or population change. For example, a household in possession of an $800,000 house, $5,000 in mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000. Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household's assets (900,000 - $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets. The wealth —more specifically, the median net worth—of households in the United States is varied with relation to race, education, geographic location and gender. As one would expect, households with greater income feature the highest net worths, though high income cannot be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth. Overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise, with baby boomers hitting the highs of their careers. In addition, wealth is unevenly distributed, with the wealthiest 25% of US households owning 87% of the wealth in the United States, which was $54.2 trillion in 2009. Including human capital such as skills, the United Nations estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $118 trillion.","Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth , which is the sum of all assets , including home equity , minus all liabilities . The total net worth of US households and nonprofit organizations 1945–2009, unadjusted for inflation or population change. For example, a household in possession of an $800,000 house, $5,000 in mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000. Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household's assets (900,000 - $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets. The wealth —more specifically, the median net worth—of households in the United States is varied with relation to race, education, geographic location and gender. As one would expect, households with greater income feature the highest net worths, though high income cannot be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth.

Q576,how many innings in overtime in baseball,Innings,"An inning, or innings, is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports – most notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring. In cricket, the term innings is both singular and plural and is always spelled and pronounced with the terminal ""s"". In baseball and softball , the singular form is inning and only the plural takes an ""s"". In many other sports, the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item. In baseball and cricket, however, one team, said to be ""batting"", attempts to score ""runs""—see run (baseball) and run (cricket) —while the other team, said to be ""fielding"", attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out. The teams switch places after the fielding team has succeeded in getting a fixed number of players out, making a clock unnecessary. In cricket, the term innings is also used to refer to the play of one particular player (Smith had a poor innings, scoring only 12). By extension, this term can be used in British English for almost any activity which takes a period of time (The Liberal government had a good innings, but finally lost office in 1972, or You've had a fair innings, now it's my turn, meaning ""you have spoken for long enough, now let me speak""). It is also used in reference to someone who has died at a reasonably old age or lived a rich and rewarding life (Ah, well. John was 89. At least he had a good innings). The baseball-derived parallel to this in American English is the term at bat . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term innings has been used in reference to cricket since at least 1735. As cricket was a mature, highly organized sport in the 1600s in England, the term's origin could well precede this first recorded usage. The word inning meaning 'a gathering in' is first recorded in 1522, and could be related.","An inning, or innings, is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports – most notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring.

New England is bordered by New York state to the southwest, Quebec to the northwest, and New Brunswick and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. In one of the earliest English settlements in North America, Pilgrims from England first settled in New England in 1620, to form Plymouth Colony .

Over the next 130 years, New England fought in four French and Indian Wars , until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America. In the late 18th century, the New England Colonies initiated the resistance to the British Parliament's efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists . The Boston Tea Party was a protest to which Great Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government, which were termed the "" Intolerable Acts "" by the colonists. The confrontation led to open warfare in 1775, the expulsion of the British authorities from New England in spring 1776, and the Declaration of Independence in July 1776. Some of the first movements of American literature , philosophy , and education originated in New England. The region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery , and was the first region of the United States to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution . Today, New England is a major world center of education, high technology, insurance, and medicine. Boston is its cultural, financial, educational, medical and transportation center. Each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as New England towns , which are often governed by town meeting .

Q2038,what is reagan known for,Presidency of Ronald Reagan,"The United States presidency of Ronald Reagan , also known as the Reagan administration, was a Republican administration headed by Ronald Reagan from January 20, 1981, to January 20, 1989. Domestically, the administration favored reducing government programs and introduced the largest across-the-board tax cuts in American history. The economic policies enacted in 1981, known as "" Reaganomics "", were an example of supply-side economics . Reagan aimed to encourage entrepreneurship and limit the growth of social spending, as well as the reduction of regulation and inflation . Economic growth saw a strong recovery in the 1980s, helping Reagan to win a landslide re-election . The national debt increased significantly, however. Regarding foreign policy , the administration was steadfastly anti-communist , calling the Soviet Union an "" evil empire "" and ending 1970s détente . Reagan accelerated the massive buildup of the military started by his predecessor , including an invasion of Grenada , the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War . The "" Reagan Doctrine "" controversially granted aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow communist governments, particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan . Reagan also promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems in order to confront the Soviets and their allies. In diplomacy, Reagan forged a strong alliance with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , and he met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev four times, aiming to shrink the superpowers ' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency has been termed the ""Reagan Revolution"", or the Age of Reagan in recognition of the political realignment both within and beyond the U.S. in favor of his brand of conservatism and his faith in free markets . The Reagan administration worked toward the collapse of Soviet Communism, and it did collapse just as he left office. Victory in the Cold War led to a unipolar world with the U.S. as the world's sole superpower. While the damaging Iran-Contra affair engulfed several Reagan aides during his second term, Reagan himself left office with a 63 percent approval rating , one of the higher approval ratings of departing presidents. After years of unstinting praise from the right, and unrelenting criticism from the left, historian David Henry finds that by 2009 a consensus had emerged among scholars that Reagan revived conservatism and turned the nation to the right by demonstrating a ""pragmatic conservatism"" that promoted ideology within the constraints imposed by the divided political system.

FURTHERMORE, SAYS HENRY, THE CONSENSUS VIEWPOINT AGREES THAT HE REVIVED FAITH IN THE PRESIDENCY AND AMERICAN SELF-CONFIDENCE, AND CONTRIBUTED CRITICALLY TO ENDING THE COLD WAR .",true,relevant,relevant,28.707257875001233
Q2066,what is kathmandu known for,Kathmandu,"Kathmandu ( ; ) is the capital and largest urban agglomerate of Nepal . The agglomerate consists of Kathmandu Metropolitan City at its core, and its sister cities Patan , Kirtipur , Thimi , and Bhaktapur . It also includes the recently recognized urban areas of Shankhapur , Karyabinayak , and Champapur . Banepa , Dhulikhel , and Panauti are satellite urban areas of Kathmandu located just outside the Kathmandu valley . Kathmandu is also known informally as ""KTM"" or the ""tri-city"". According to a census conducted in 2011, Kathmandu metropolis alone has 975,453 inhabitants; and the agglomerate has a population of more than 2.5 million inhabitants. The metropolitan city area is and has a population density of 19,250 per km2. The city stands at an elevation of approximately in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. It is surrounded by four major mountains: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur , and Bhaktapur ), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population. During Rana and Shah eras, the name ""Nepal"" referred only to the Kathmandu Valley; it was what people who lived outside the valley called it. During this period, British historians called the valley itself ""Nepal Proper"". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Central Development Region of Nepal . The Central Region comprises three zones: Bagmati, Narayani , and Janakpur. Kathmandu is located in the Bagmati Zone . Kathmandu is the gateway to tourism in Nepal. It is also the nerve center of the country's economy . It has the most advanced infrastructure of any urban area in Nepal, and its economy is focused on tourism, which accounted for 3.8% of Nepal's GDP in 1995–96.

The city has a rich history, spanning nearly 2000 years, as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Most of Kathmandu's people follow Hinduism and many others follow Buddhism . There are people of other religious beliefs as well, giving Kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture. Nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city. Nepal Bhasa is the indigenous language spoken by the Newar people. Hindi is widely understood and English is understood by Kathmandu's educated residents. The city's literacy rate is 98%.

The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia . The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia . Serbian military officers stood behind the attack. At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević , his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and Masterspy Rade Malobabić. Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary. The assassins, the key members of the clandestine tunnel, and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records. Assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later.","A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination and steps of Gavrilo Princip (image taken in 1987, before steps were removed in 1992 and plaque changed from Cyrillic to Latin script) A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination (image taken in 2009) ON 28 JUNE 1914, ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND OF AUSTRIA , HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN THRONE, AND HIS WIFE, SOPHIE, DUCHESS OF HOHENBERG , WERE SHOT DEAD IN SARAJEVO , BY GAVRILO PRINCIP , ONE OF A GROUP OF SIX BOSNIAN SERB ASSASSINS COORDINATED BY DANILO ILIĆ .

Q2412,where was the first canal in panama located,Panama Canal,"Location of Panama between Pacific (bottom) and Caribbean (top), with canal at top center The Panama Canal () is a ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean (via the Caribbean Sea ) to the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake ( above sea-level). Gatun Lake was created to reduce the amount of work required for the canal. The current locks are wide. A third, wider lane of locks is being built. France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States (US) later took over the project and took a decade to complete the canal in 1914, enabling ships to avoid the lengthy Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America (via the Drake Passage ) or to navigate the Strait of Magellan . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut made it possible for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in half the time previously required. The shorter, faster, safer route to the US West Coast and to nations in and along the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy. During this time, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American; the United States completed the construction. The canal was taken over in 1999 by the Panamanian government, as long planned. Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships when the canal opened in 1914, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons .

Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints with an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting. Except in the case of monotyping , the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print produced is not considered a ""copy"" but rather is considered an ""original"". This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process, and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique. A print may be known as an impression. Printmaking (other than monotyping) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions, but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to. Prints are created by transferring ink from a matrix or through a prepared screen to a sheet of paper or other material. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates for engraving or etching ; stone, aluminum, or polymer for lithography ; blocks of wood for woodcuts and wood engravings ; and linoleum for linocuts .

Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961. Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California. He graduated from Whittier College in 1934 and Duke University School of Law in 1937, returning to California to practice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon , moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942. He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II . Nixon was elected in California to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 . His pursuit of the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election . Nixon served for eight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962 . In 1968, he ran again for the presidency and was elected . Although Nixon initially escalated America's involvement in the Vietnam War , he subsequently ended U.S. involvement in 1973. Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. Domestically, his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states. Among other things, he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs , imposed wage and price controls, enforced desegregation of some Southern schools, and established the Environmental Protection Agency . Though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with Apollo 11 , he scaled back manned space exploration. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972. Nixon's second term saw an Arab oil embargo , the resignation of his vice president, Spiro Agnew , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal and other misconduct by members of the administration. The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he controversially received a pardon issued by his successor, Gerald Ford . In retirement, Nixon's work as an elder statesman , authoring several books and undertaking many foreign trips, helped to rehabilitate his public image.

This is the most common Hebrew construction for the singular but is used mostly in Ezekiel (93 times) and 14 times elsewhere. In thirty two cases the phrase appears in intermediate plural form ""sons of men"", i.e. human beings. As generally interpreted by Jews, it denotes humankind generally. In the Koine Greek of the New Testament , ""the son of man"" is invariably used as ""ὁ υἱὸς τοὺ ἀνθρώπου"" with a definite article. The use of the definite article in ""the son of man"" in the Christian gospels is novel, and before its use there, no records of its use in any of the surviving Greek documents of antiquity exist.

Q2790,where was the first march madness game played,NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship,"The NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship is a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 college basketball teams, to determine the national championship of the major college basketball teams. The tournament, organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was created during 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches , and was the idea of Ohio State University coach Harold Olsen . Played mostly during March, it is known informally as March Madness or the Big Dance, and has become one of the most famous annual sporting events in the United States. The NCAA has credited Bob Walsh of the Seattle Organizing Committee for starting the March Madness celebration during 1984. The tournament teams include champions from 31 Division I conferences (which receive automatic bids ), and 37 teams which are awarded at-large berths . These ""at-large"" teams are chosen by an NCAA selection committee, as detailed below . The 64 teams are divided into four regions and organized into a single elimination ""bracket"", which predetermines, when a team wins a game, which team it will face next. Each team is ""seeded"", or ranked, within its region. After an initial four games between eight lower-ranked teams, the tournament occurs during the course of three weekends, at pre-selected neutral sites around the United States. Lower-ranked teams are placed in the bracket against higher ranked teams. Each weekend eliminates three-fourths of the teams, from a round of 64, to a ""Sweet Sixteen"", and for the last weekend of the Tournament a Final Four; the Final Four is usually played during the first weekend of April. These four teams, one from each region, then compete in one location for the national championship. The tournament has been at least partially televised since 1969. Presently, the games are reported by CBS , TBS , TNT , and truTV by the trade-name NCAA March Madness . Since 2011, all games are available for viewing nationwide. As television coverage has grown, so too has the tournament's popularity. Presently, millions of Americans ""fill out a bracket"", predicting winners of all 67 games. With 11 national titles, UCLA has the record for the most NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships; John Wooden coached UCLA to 10 of its 11 titles.

The tournament, organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was created during 1939 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches , and was the idea of Ohio State University coach Harold Olsen . Played mostly during March, it is known informally as March Madness or the Big Dance, and has become one of the most famous annual sporting events in the United States. The NCAA has credited Bob Walsh of the Seattle Organizing Committee for starting the March Madness celebration during 1984. The tournament teams include champions from 31 Division I conferences (which receive automatic bids ), and 37 teams which are awarded at-large berths . These ""at-large"" teams are chosen by an NCAA selection committee, as detailed below . The 64 teams are divided into four regions and organized into a single elimination ""bracket"", which predetermines, when a team wins a game, which team it will face next. Each team is ""seeded"", or ranked, within its region. After an initial four games between eight lower-ranked teams, the tournament occurs during the course of three weekends, at pre-selected neutral sites around the United States. Lower-ranked teams are placed in the bracket against higher ranked teams. Each weekend eliminates three-fourths of the teams, from a round of 64, to a ""Sweet Sixteen"", and for the last weekend of the Tournament a Final Four; the Final Four is usually played during the first weekend of April. These four teams, one from each region, then compete in one location for the national championship. The tournament has been at least partially televised since 1969. Presently, the games are reported by CBS , TBS , TNT , and truTV by the trade-name NCAA March Madness . Since 2011, all games are available for viewing nationwide. As television coverage has grown, so too has the tournament's popularity. Presently, millions of Americans ""fill out a bracket"", predicting winners of all 67 games. With 11 national titles, UCLA has the record for the most NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships; John Wooden coached UCLA to 10 of its 11 titles. The University of Kentucky is second, with 8 national titles, while Indiana University and the University of North Carolina are tied for third with 5 national titles.

Rocket engines are reaction engines and obtain thrust in accordance with Newton's third law . Since they need no external material to form their jet, rocket engines can be used for spacecraft propulsion as well as terrestrial uses, such as missiles . Most rocket engines are internal combustion engines , although non-combusting forms also exist. Rocket engines as a group have the highest exhaust velocities, are by far the lightest, but are the least propellant efficient of all types of jet engines.","RS-68 being tested at NASA's Stennis Space Center.

Q2544,what is high sticking in hockey,High-Sticking,"A referee calling a high-sticking penaltyHigh -sticking is the name of two infractions in the sport of ice hockey that may occur when a player intentionally or inadvertently plays with his or her stick above the height of the shoulders or above the cross bar of a hockey goal. This can result in a stoppage of play or in a penalty. In the rules of the National Hockey League , high-sticking is defined as a penalty in Rule 60 and as a non-penalty foul in Rule 80. A stoppage in play results if a high stick comes in contact with the puck and the team who touched it regains control of the puck. However, play usually continues if a player touches the puck with a high stick and the opposing team gains control of the puck. If the puck goes into the opposing net after coming into contact with a high stick, the goal is disallowed. The level at which a stick is considered too high for a goal is the crossbar of the net. However, if a player knocks the puck into his own net with a high stick, the goal is allowed. A penalty is assessed if a player strikes another player with a high stick. The player is given a minor penalty unless his high stick caused an injury, in which case the referee has the option to assess a double-minor, major or match penalty. It is the referee's discretion which penalty to assess: the rule calls for a double minor for an accidental injury, or a match penalty for a deliberate attempt to injure (whether the opposition player was actually injured). Injury is usually decided by the high stick causing bleeding, but the presence of blood does not automatically mean an extra penalty is awarded. Some referees have been known to award an extra penalty without the presence of blood if the referee determines that the injury sustained was sufficient to warrant a double-minor penalty.","A referee calling a high-sticking penaltyHigh -STICKING IS THE NAME OF TWO INFRACTIONS IN THE SPORT OF ICE HOCKEY THAT MAY OCCUR WHEN A PLAYER INTENTIONALLY OR INADVERTENTLY PLAYS WITH HIS OR HER STICK ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE SHOULDERS OR ABOVE THE CROSS BAR OF A HOCKEY GOAL.

Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia , which they expected to bring an early end to the rebellion.

Q195,how is canada's health care,Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States,"Health spending per capita, in $US PPP-adjusted , with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations. Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States are often made by government, public health and public policy analysts . The two countries had similar health care systems before Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States spends much more money on health care than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP. In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714. The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on health care in that year; Canada spent 10.0%. In 2006, 70% of health care spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on health care was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics don't take into account population differences. Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending. A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that ""health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent."" Life expectancy is longer in Canada, and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S., but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences. One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of ""overall health service performance"", which used a ""composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution"", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations. This study rated the US ""responsiveness"", or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada. While the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US, simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an effective way of determining which healthcare system is superior. The WHO's study methods were criticized by some analyses. Although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care, assuming the population makeup is similar, a recent report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data and notes the ""difficult research issues"" facing international comparisons.","Health spending per capita, in $US PPP-adjusted , with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations.

Q2390,what is the disease osteonecrosis of the jaw?,Osteonecrosis of the jaw,"Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a severe bone disease that affects the maxilla and the mandible . Various forms of ONJ have been described over the last 160 years, and a number of causes have been suggested in the literature. Osteonecrosis of the jaws associated with bisphosphonate therapy, required by some cancer treatment regimens, has been identified and defined as a pathological entity since 2003. The possible risk from lower oral doses of bisphosphonates, taken by patients to prevent or treat osteoporosis , remains uncertain. Various treatment options have been explored, however severe cases of ONJ still require surgical removal of the affected bone. A thorough history and assessement of pre-existing systemic problems and possible sites of dental infection are required to help prevent the condition, especially if bisphosphonate therapy is considered.","OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAW (ONJ) IS A SEVERE BONE DISEASE THAT AFFECTS THE MAXILLA AND THE MANDIBLE .
